# Smart Meeting Summarizer


## Description
Developed an end-to-end meeting intelligence tool that transcribes, summarizes, and extracts actionable items from recorded discussions. The system processes .mp3 audio files through the OpenAI API for speech-to-text transcription, applies spaCy-based NLP pipelines to identify and cluster action verbs (e.g., schedule, update, review), and generates concise meeting summaries via OpenAIâ€™s text-generation API. Demonstrates skills in Python, NLP, API integration, and automation to deliver a practical productivity tool used to turn a user's meeting into a structured summary.
